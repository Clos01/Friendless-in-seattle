  ## Description
  Pandemic life has meant a lot of changes for many, including moving to a new town or city.
  Between lockdowns, working remotely, and masks, how do you organically make new friends in your new environment? 
  Well, you don’t. You’re Friendless in Seattle. 
  Our app helps you connect locally or remotely with people that share your interests so that you can make a new friend… or seven! 

  Friendless in Seattle helps you meet new friends locally or around the world that share your interests.
  
  ## User Story
  ``` md
  If I register and fill out my ‘profile’ and choose to meet virtual or local friends and choose an interest category, 
  then when others are selecting the same criteria it will populate my friends page. 
  If I select “message” on a friend in my friends page, 
  then I am taken to a page that contains messages between myself and just that friend. 
  When I view the messages page, I am presented with messages that I have open.
  ```
